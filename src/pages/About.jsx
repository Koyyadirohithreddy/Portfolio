            I'm Koyyadi Rohith Reddy, a recent graduate from the Computer Science at Auburn University at Montgomery.

            I'm originally from India, but I now live in the Montgomery, where I'm currently looking for opportunities.

            Without knowing it, I think I've always been a coder at heart - having the chance to learn and develop myself is what motivates me more than anything else, and I love being able to combine my creative side with problem solving skills. I'm organized, detail-oriented, motivated and adaptable.</p>
